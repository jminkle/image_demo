# image_demo
using images with a database in flask

You will need a DATABASE_URL environment variable set that will connect to a database. I tested with a postresql database. See *create.sql* for the table definition.

All the code was taken from https://github.com/jbshep/flask-image-demo. I set it up to connect to a database with a URL.
